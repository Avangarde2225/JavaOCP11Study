/*
Interface:
A reference type that can contain method signatures, default methods, static methods, nested types and constants.

* Interfaces cannot be instantiated
* A clas can implement one or more interfaces
* An interface cannot contain a constructor
* Usually  interface methods do not have a body
* Default and static methods have been introduced in recent versons of Java

Why to use interfaces
* abstraction : Hide away implementation details
* Mimic multiple inheritance:

Interfaces can also contain constants
Fields defined in interfaces are public, static and final by default
